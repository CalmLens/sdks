Uploads and text classification take `authorId` and `context`: who wrote the content and the earlier posts of its conversation, oldest first, each with an optional author ID. CalmLens moderates only the content and uses the earlier posts to read who it addresses and whether it quotes, reports, counters or mocks something. The SDKs send only the posts CalmLens uses, the most recent 5 that fit in 2,000 characters, and export the rule that picks them. Assets return `authorId` and the `context` used, which is `null` once the content is removed. The offline mocks store both and drop the context with the content.
